## Philosophy

Small, deterministic commits.
No magic. No hidden behavior.

## Rules

- One issue → one PR
- **Git Workflow**:
  - Each task MUST be developed in a branch named after its `readyToDev/` filename.
  - After completion, commit and push the branch.
  - Copy the completed task file from `readyToDev/` to `issues_done/`.
- No feature creep
- No implicit side effects

## Coding Standards

- Explicit types
- No global state
- Pure functions where possible

## AI Usage

- AI is allowed only for implementation
- Architecture decisions are human-only
- All AI output must be reviewed
